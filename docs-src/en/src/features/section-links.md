## Section Links

You can link to another section, e.g. the [section about the glossary](section:glossary) using a section link of the format &#0091;link title&#0093;&#0040;section:section-slug&#0041;

Section links will be replaced with a link suitable for the output format, for some formats, which do not support link targets, it makes sense to render them only as text (e.g. in a Deckset slide deck)
