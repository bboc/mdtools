## Usecases

The biggest use case at the moment is the [S3 Practical Guide](https://patterns-sociocracy30.org), the "official" documentation for Sociocracy 3.0. It's compiled from ~100 source files into static website, ebooks and pdfs, and translated into several languages.

I also use it for all my slide for trainings, workshops and conferences, some [examples are on slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/BernhardBockelbrink/)
