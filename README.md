# mdtools

commandline scripts for processing (multi-)markdown files


## mdslides

A powerful set of tools to build slide decks from repositories of Markdown files for use in [Deckset](http://decksetapp.com), [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) and Wordpress. This helps with reuse of slides and evolution of large decks, e.g. [Sociocracy 3.0 - All Patterns Explained](http://sociocracy30.org/slides/s3-all-patterns-explained.html).

See [the mdslides documentation](slides/slides.md) for more information.

## Image Update 

Update image references in MultiMarkdown files (while preserving Deckset formatting). This is helpful when maintaining a large set of illustrations used in a large number of markdown file, because it allows for changing the folder structure of the illustrations without having to worry about updating all the references.

Usage: see `mdimg -h`


## mddiff

Output diff between two Markdown files as Critic Markup

Usage: see `mddiff -h`

## Upcoming

* file transclusion for Multimarkdown files (with error output for missing files) (currently located in [this repository]())
