title: "Usecases"

The biggest use case at the moment is the [S3 Practical Guide](https://patterns-sociocracy30.org), the "official" documentation for Sociocracy 3.0. It's compiled from ~100 source files into static website, ebooks and pdfs, and translated into several languages.

I also use it for all my slide for trainings, workshops and conferences, some [examples are on slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/BernhardBockelbrink/)



<div class="bottom-nav">
<a href="introduction.html" title="Up: What is this?">▲</a> <a href="formats.html" title="Read next: Formats">▶ Read next: Formats</a>
</div>


<script type="text/javascript">
Mousetrap.bind('g n', function() {
    window.location.href = 'formats.html';
    return false;
});
</script>
