## What is this?

_mdtools_ is a set of command line tools written in Python that to render markdown content into ebooks, slide decks and static websites you can host on any web server, or as a GitHub page.

You can read this documentation as a [slide deck](https://bboc.github.io/mdtools/slides.html) or as a [website]()
## Usecases

The biggest use case at the moment is the [S3 Practical Guide](https://patterns-sociocracy30.org), the "official" documentation for Sociocracy 3.0. It's compiled from ~100 source files into static website, ebooks and pdfs, and translated into several languages.

I also use it for all my slide for trainings, workshops and conferences, some [examples are on slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/BernhardBockelbrink/)
