title: "Styles and Assets for reveal.js Builds"
---


The folder `docs/reveal.js` contains all files related to reveal.js builds.

However, the reveal.js-builder is currently broken. So sad.


<div class="bottom-nav">
<a href="jekyll-builds.html" title="Back to: Styles and Assets for Jekyll/GitHub Pages">◀</a> <a href="styles-and-assets.html" title="Up: Styles and Other Assets">▲</a> <a href="translation.html" title="Read next: Translation">▶ Read next: Translation</a>
</div>


<script type="text/javascript">
Mousetrap.bind('g n', function() {
    window.location.href = 'translation.html';
    return false;
});
</script>
