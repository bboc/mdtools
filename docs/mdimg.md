`mdimg` brings two tools that are helpful when maintaining a large set of illustrations used in a large number of markdown file: 

* check for duplicates images
* update image references 

This allows for changing the folder structure of the illustrations without having to worry about updating all the references in your slide decks or other texts. 

The only prerequsite is that each image has an unique filename.

Usage: see `mdimg -h`
