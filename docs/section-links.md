title: "Section Links"
---


You can link to another section, e.g. the [section about the glossary](glossary.html) using a section link of the format &#0091;link title&#0093;&#0040;section:section-slug&#0041;

Section links will be replaced with a link suitable for the output format, for some formats, which do not support link targets, it makes sense to render them only as text (e.g. in a Deckset slide deck)

<div class="bottom-nav">
<a href="glossary-entries.html" title="Back to: Glossary">◀</a> <a href="features.html" title="Up: Features">▲</a> <a href="macros.html" title="">▶ Read next: Macros</a>
</div>


<script type="text/javascript">
Mousetrap.bind('g n', function() {
    window.location.href = 'macros.html';
    return false;
});
</script>
