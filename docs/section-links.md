title: "Section Links"
---


You can link to another section, e.g. the [section about the glossary](glossary.html) using a section link.

Section links will be replaced with a link suitable for the output format, for some formats, which do not support link targets, it makes sense to render them only as text (e.g. in a Deckset slide deck)

[&#9654; Chapter Headers](chapter-headers.html)<br/>[&#9664; Glossary](glossary.html)<br/>[&#9650; Features](features.html)
