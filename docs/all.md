title: mdtools Documentation
---

### What is this?

_mdtools_ is a set of command line tools written in Python that to render markdown content into ebooks, slide decks and static websites you can host on any web server, or as a GitHub page.

You can read this documentation as a [slide deck](https://bboc.github.io/mdtools/slides.html) or as a [website]()

#### Usecases

The biggest use case at the moment is the [S3 Practical Guide](https://patterns-sociocracy30.org), the "official" documentation for Sociocracy 3.0. It's compiled from ~100 source files into static website, ebooks and pdfs, and translated into several languages.

I also use it for all my slide for trainings, workshops and conferences, some [examples are on slideshare](https://www.slideshare.net/BernhardBockelbrink/)



### Formats

_mdslides_ can render the output in various formats:

* Markdown for Deckset
* epub (using pandoc)
* a HTML file for reveal.js
* a PDF
* a static website using Jekyll



#### Deckset

Deckset is a presenter for markdown slides. It is nice for small slide decks, but lacks a few features one would want when creating larger decks. 

#### Jekyll

Jekyll is a static website generator, also which is used for creating github pages.


## Features


#### Glossary

_A **glossary** is collection of explanations for words the reader might not be familiar with._

mdtools expects the glossary in a YAML-file, and can do a few tricks with it: 

- insert glossary explanations or definitions into the text using _&#0123;&#0123;glossary:glossary-term&#0125;&#0125;_ or _&#0123;&#0123;define:glossary-term&#0125;&#0125;_
- render a full glossary using _&#0123;&#0123;insert-full-glossary&#0125;&#0125;_
- add an explanation for a <a href="#" class="tooltip" title="Glossary: A collection of explanations for words the reader might not be familiar with.">glossary</a> term as an overlay (in html output) using _&#0091;glossary&#0093;&#0040;glossary:glossary&#0041;_


#### Glossary Format:

    terms:
      my-term:
        name: My Term
        definition: what you want to display in the definition of the term
        glossary: what you want to put into the glossary


#### Glossary Item Style (ebook only)

The ebook writer allows for replacing of glossary links with footnotes, plain text, LaTeX underline or custom formats

Simply add the commandline option `--glossary-style` for rendering glossary links:

- `--glossary-style=plain` (default) removes the glossary link by replacing it with the link title
- `--glossary-style=footnotes` renders them as footnote references (and appends a list of footnotes into tmp-appendix.md)
- `--glossary-style=underline` replaces links with LaTeX markup for underline



#### Glossary Item Style (ebook only)


Variables in the template are:

- **title**: the title of the link in the text
- **term**: the glossary term (identifier in the glossary yaml file)
- **name**: the name of the glossary term in the yaml file)
- **description**: the description of the glossary term


#### Section Links

You can link to another section, e.g. the _section about the glossary_ using a section link of the format &#0091;link title&#0093;&#0040;section:section-slug&#0041;

Section links will be replaced with a link suitable for the output format, for some formats, which do not support link targets, it makes sense to render them only as text (e.g. in a Deckset slide deck)

#### Chapter Headers

{>>TODO: insert section about chapter headers <<}

#### Index Files

{>>TODO: explain automatic transfusion of chapter index files <<}

## Data Structure

_mdslides_ expects your content in specific directories, and relies on a set of configuration files. It also requires certain directories for temp files, which can be set up with a command in _mdslides_.



### Defining the Project Structure

The project structure is made up of individual content files nodes in a folder structure. Which files are included is defined in a simple yaml file, often called `structure.yaml`. The same files can be re-used in different structures.

Consider this example:

<pre>
foobar.md
foobar/foo.md
foobar/bar.md
foobar/baz.md
foobar/baz/something.md
part2.md
</pre>


The yaml file to render all these files would look like this:

<pre>
parts:
  - id: foobar
    parts: 
    - foo
    - bar
    - id: baz
      tags: [one-tag, another-tag]
      parts:
      - something
- part2
</pre>


The yaml file defines which files to include, and in what order. 

Things that go together can simple be grouped into folders. For some flexibility when growing a document, mdtools is looking in several places when it encounters a document node that sub-nodes, e.g. for a node `foobar` it looks for:

<pre>
foobar.md
foobar/index.md
foobar/foobar.md
foorbar/foobar_index.md
</pre>

Pick a style that makes sense for your usecase.



### Configuration

TODO: describe config format



### Templates

{>>TODO:  <<} 

### Macros

A macro ("macroinstruction") is a programmable pattern which translates a certain sequence of input into a preset sequence of output.

Macros can be registered to certain renderers, and can take parameters that control how they are expanded.

All macros look like this: _&#0123;&#0123;name:parameters&#0125;&#0125;_ 

Makros may take parameters. Two parameters are processed before the macro is executed:

- **only**: macro is executed _only_ for the specified preset(s)
- **skip**: macro is _skipped_ for the specified preset(s)

Presets are separated with '|'

Examples:

   &#0123;&#0123;index:ignore=jekyll|all-in-one&#0125;&#0125;_
   &#0123;&#0123;index:only=jekyll&#0125;&#0125;_

#### Custom Macros

Creating custom macros is easy, they only need to provide a render method:

    def render_my_macro(config, structure, *args, **kwargs):
        return "macros will be replaced with this text"


Macros have access to the project configuration and to the content structure, so that they can create indexes and links, and are able to react on configuration parameters.


Example: the index below is rendered via &#0123;&#0123;index:root=indexes,sort=title,style=list&#0125;&#0125;)

- [A searchable index](index-demo-searchable.html)
- [Index demo: Summaries](index-demo-summary.html)
- [The Index Macro](index-macro.html)
- [The Menu Macro](menu-macro.html)




### The Index Macro

<summary>The _index macro_ can render parts of the structure as an index in various styles and formats.</summary>

_&#0123;&#0123;index:root=node_name,tag=value,style=value,sort=value,only=value&#0125;&#0125;_ 

Render a subset of the structure as index. 

Parameters:

-   root: (optional) only show children of one specific node in the index
-   tag: filter index for nodes with a specific tag (filter is applied after root!)
-   style: how the index will look:
    - summary: one entry per paragraph: title and summary
    - list: a list with one entry per item
-   only: jekyll
-   sort: sort index by node attribute, e.g. title 
- force_format: force a specific format (e.g. plain)



### Index demo: Summaries

<summary>This page demonstrates a simple index with summaries</summary>

_mdtools_ picks up the contents of the &lt;summary&gt;-tag for each page, therefore the index macro can output summaries like so:

&#0123;&#0123;index:root=indexes,sort=title,style=summary&#0125;&#0125;

<dl>

  <dt><a href="index-demo-searchable.html">A searchable index</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>

  <dt><a href="index-demo-summary.html">Index demo: Summaries</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>

  <dt><a href="index-macro.html">The Index Macro</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>

  <dt><a href="menu-macro.html">The Menu Macro</a></dt>
  <dd></dd>
</dl>


### A searchable index

<summary>This page demonstrates a searchable index.</summary>

This obviously doesn't make sense in an ebook.

&#0123;&#0123;sort=title,style=searchable,only=jekyll&#0125;&#0125;




### The Menu Macro

â€¦ renders HTML for [SmartMenus for jQuery](https://www.smartmenus.org/)

for use in templates.

Code: &#0123;&#0123;html-menu&#0125;&#0125;


## Commands


### Makefile and Tempfolder

`mdbuild` typically does not create the final output formats but compiles the source files that are required by other tools (jekyll, latexmk, pandoc) for  rendering the output. For some formats a temporary folder is required, and the temp folder requires a bit of housekeeping.

A good practice way for bringing together preprocessing and rendering the final output is a [makefile](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) that defines one rule per output format, and a rule for cleaning and setting up the temporary folder.  

`mdtools` containts a sample makefile and a sample project.yaml that demonstrate how this all fits togeter, as well as a sample buildscript that runs clean, setup, and build rules for all target formats in sequence. For most applications all it would take to get going is this:

1. set the desired output filename in config/local-conf
2. remove or comment the target formats that are not required

Then you can run `make <format>` to test one specific format, and `source build.sh` for a clean build of all formats. 



### mdbuild


`mdbuild` is the main build command for convertin the source into several target formats.

Usage: see `mdbuild -h`




### mdslides


**Note: this command is currently deactivated!!!

`mdslides` brings several commands for

* `compile` creates one Markdown file per chapter
* `build` builds the output in various _formats_
* `convert` converts a Deckset slide deck to reveal.js or to output for Wordpress (with Jetpack or another Markdown plugin)
* `skeleton` parses a config file and creates folders for chapters and files for sections
* `deckset-index` (deprecated) build a translatable index file (the new config format will make this obsolete)
* 'template' Inject translations (and optionally parameters from a config) into a template file.



### mdimg


`mdimg` brings two tools that are helpful when maintaining a large set of illustrations used in a large number of markdown file: 

* check for duplicates images
* update image references 

This allows for changing the folder structure of the illustrations without having to worry about updating all the references in your slide decks or other texts. 

The only prerequsite is that each image has an unique filename.

Usage: see `mdimg -h`




## Styles and Other Assets

<summary>The various output formats require certain styles and other assets, this part of the documentation explains where goes what.</summary>

Since this documentation makes use of all those formats, so you can find everything described here this repository.

### Styles and Assets for Jekyll/GitHub Pages

Unless it's replaced at build time via an entry in `config.presets.templates`, the following subdirectories of `docs` typicall contain templates and other resources for you site:

- `_includes`: partials to be included by the templates in `_layouts`
- `_layouts`: the templates for the different page or tsypes you can use in your site
- `_sass`:  SCSS paritals that are processed into a single CSS fle
- `css`: css files, either compiled by Jekyll, or added manually
- `js`:
- `menu`: files related to smartmenus

see the [Jekyll documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/) for more information.


### Styles and Assets for reveal.js Builds

The folder `docs/reveal.js` contains all files related to reveal.js builds.

However, the reveal.js-builder is currently broken. So sad.


### Translation

It is very simple to translate a _mdtools_ project into another language, as all translatable content is kept in a single directory and is stored in text files which all common translation platforms can easily pick up. 

Simply drop the translated content into a new project, and you're ready to go.

#### Translating Templates

If templates contain translatable content, simply store them inside the content directory, and copy them to where you need them in the makefile.
