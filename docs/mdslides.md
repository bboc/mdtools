* `build` builds the output in various [formats](formats.html)
* `convert` converts a Deckset slide deck to reveal.js or to output for Wordpress (with Jetpack or another Markdown plugin)
* `skeleton` parses a config file and creates folders for chapters and files for sections
* `deckset-index` (deprecated) build a translatable index file (the new config format will make this obsolete)
