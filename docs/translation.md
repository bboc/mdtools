title: "Translation"
---


It is very simple to translate a _mdtools_ project into another language, as all translatable content is kept in a single directory and is stored in text files which all common translation platforms can easily pick up. 

Simply drop the translated content into a new project, and you're ready to go.

<script type="text/javascript">
Mousetrap.bind('g n', function() {
    window.location.href = 'translating-templates.html';
    return false;
});
