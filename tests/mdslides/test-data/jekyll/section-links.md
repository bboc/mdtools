Here is a section link: [Glossary Entries](glossary-entries.html)

It should be possible to link to several sections in the same line, e.g. to [Background Images](background-images.html) and [Glossary Entries](glossary-entries.html)

Also we should be able to have a <dfn data-info="Glossary: A collection of explanations for words the reader might not be familiar with.">glossary</dfn> and a section link to [Glossary Entries](glossary-entries.html) and another overlay for <dfn data-info="Term: An entry in the glossary.">term</dfn>.
