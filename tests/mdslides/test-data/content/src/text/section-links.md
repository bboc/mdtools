## Section Links

Here is a section link: [Glossary Entries](section:glossary-entries)

It should be possible to link to several sections in the same line, e.g. to [Background Images](section:background-images) and [Glossary Entries](section:glossary-entries)

Also we should be able to have a [glossary](glossary:glossary) and a section link to [Glossary Entries](section:glossary-entries) and another overlay for [term](glossary:term).
